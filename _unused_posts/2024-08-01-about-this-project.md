<h3>About this Project</h3><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">The <strong>Online Resources for African American Language (ORAAL)</strong> project seeks to bring together information and resources about language in the African American community, for educators, researchers, and the&nbsp;public.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">African American Language (AAL), sometimes called African American English (AAE), African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Black English, or Ebonics, represents a rich and diverse set of varieties of American English. Its history is as old as America and its linguistic structure is as systematic and as normal&nbsp;as other varieties of English, in the U.S. and elsewhere. Yet, African American Language is often misrepresented and misunderstood.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">This website, <strong>oraal.uoregon.edu</strong>, came online in January 2018. It houses information about AAL, including our page on <a id="Facts" name="Facts"></a><strong><a href="/AAL">About AAL</a></strong>, which includes some <em>Frequently Asked Questions about AAL</em> as well as several categories from the development of AAL, the linguistic background, and information about some controversies that have revolved around AAL in recent decades, as well as ongoing educational disparities in the U.S. educational system, as well as an extensive <strong><a href="/AAL/Bibliography">Bibliography of African American Language Research</a></strong>. Additionally, ORAAL includes two <a href="/resources" id="Resources" name="Resources"><strong>Resources</strong></a> pages. The first, <strong><a href="/resources/educational">Educational Resources</a></strong>, includes resources from other websites and podcasts, where anyone can learn about AAL, as well as pages specifically geared towards K-12 educators and Post-Secondary educators. The second, <strong><a href="/resources/research">Research Resources</a></strong>, includes information for researchers interested in finding AAL data. ORAAL includes a <a href="/glossary" id="Glossary" name="Glossary"><strong>Glossary</strong></a> of linguistic terms that are used to scientifically describe language varieties. Finally, ORAAL is home to the <a name="coraal"></a><a href="/coraal"><strong>Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL)</strong></a>, the first public corpus of AAL data, which provides resources for researchers on this important language variety.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">We hope you find this website useful.
