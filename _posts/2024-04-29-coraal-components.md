The speakers for these recordings are part of a modern Atlanta friendship sphere, where many of the speakers were not born and raised in Atlanta, but rather moved to the city from other locations. Speakers range in age from 22 to 40 years old. Located in Georgia, as of 2020, the city of Atlanta had a population of 498,715, with the black population accounting for 46.7% of that population, while the Atlanta Metropolitan area was over 6.1 million. The city is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, which is to remember and honor African American history throughout the Civil Rights Movement and Civil War. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">Farrington, Charlie, Tyler Kendall, Patrick 'Slay' Brooks, Emma Mullen, and Chloe Tacata. 2020. </span></span><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>The Corpus of Regional African American Language: ATL (Atlanta, GA 2017)</em>.

The 68 speakers selected for CORAAL are not the exact same set of speakers analyzed by Fasold (1972).

The DDS was a foundational study of social stratification in American English in which Roger Shuy and colleagues recorded over 700 white and Black Detroit residents to determine linguistic patterns at play across ethnicity, sex, social class, and age, and the outcomes have informed work on education policy regarding vernacular American English dialects. The speakers were recorded primarily in 1966, with dates of birth ranging from 1887 to 1957. The 40 speakers selected for CORAAL are not the exact same set of speakers analyzed by Wolfram (1969). We have selected speakers to best represent three age groups and three social class groups. Metadata for DTA include broad information about speakers' demographic backgrounds from Shuy's original detailed demographic questionnaire.

The LES was the site of William Labov’s (1966) early sociolinguistic research on English in New York City. Demographically, the neighborhood changed dramatically between the 1960s and the time of Becker’s (2009) dissertation research. As of 2010, most residents (~66%) were non-white with a median income of almost half of the median income for the borough of Manhattan (Becker 2014). </span></span><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Speakers were provided by Becker for CORAAL and range in age from 24 to 84 years old. We do not focus on socioeconomic strata, but focus on providing a distribution across gender and age groups. We have attempted to capture and include in the metadata broad information about speakers’ demographic backgrounds, but leave questions of interpretation up to end users. Metadata for LES include information about speakers’ demographic backgrounds, as well as social class score and a generation value which identifies how long their family has lived in the New York City area.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">Becker, Kara. 2009.

The speakers were recorded between August 2003 and June 2004 and are between 19 and 83 years old. As of the 2000 census, African Americans composed 97% of the population (Rowe 2005).

Since the early nineteenth century, Valdosta has been home to a large African American population, particularly since the Civil War where it served as a place of refuge for many fleeing other parts of Georgia where more battles were being fought. Speakers were interviewed by Quartey to fill a 2 x 3 demographic matrix and range in age from 21 to 83 years old.
