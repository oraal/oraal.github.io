Largely unknown to outsiders, Black ASL has become a symbol of solidarity and a vital part of identity within the Black Deaf community. Different uses of space, hand use, directional movement, and facial expression are some of the ways it sets itself apart from other varieties of ASL. With the perspectives of Black signers, Sign Language interpreters, and the scholars who have worked to uncover it, SIGNING BLACK in AMERICA explores the history and development of this unique and expressive variety of visual communication."

They are in the process making several resources available on their website. Research by Stephany Dunston and colleagues (<em>The Importance of Graduate Student Engagement in a Campus Language Diversity Initiative, Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 46(3):215-228) </em>suggests that student involvement in such initiatives is critical to reach diverse audiences, both on campus and in the community, but this engagement also teaches them the importance of engagement and being able to communicate research to a wider audience.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sociolinguistic Artifacts</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">The <a href="https://www.reed.edu/slx-artifacts/" target="_blank">Sociolinguistic Artifacts</a> website was developed by Kara Becker at Reed College as a way to collect and curate sociolinguistically relevant media content.
