On this page, we highlight Black linguists who have contributed to the study of African American Language in the United States. Some have worked on AAL in the variationist sociolinguistic paradigm, while others focus on educational or psycholinguistic questions. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. At the bottom of the page, we include an <strong><a href="#In Memoriam">In Memoriam</a></strong> section.

If you have a suggestion for an addition, or if you are on this list and want to be removed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:OnlineResourcesAAL@gmail.com?subject=ORAAL%20Black%20Linguists%20List%20Addition%20Request">OnlineResourcesAAL@gmail.com</a>.

### Mark Hanna Watkins
(1903 - 1976)

Dr. Watkins was a University of Chicago trained linguist whose dissertation was a descriptive grammar of Chichewa (a Bantu language). In 2018, Dr. Arthur K.

You can find that article <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/month-linguistics-history-tribute-mark-hanna-watkins" target="_blank">here</a>. While Dr. Watkins did not work on the speech of African Americans, we want to celebrate his contributions to linguistics as the first African American to receive his PhD in linguistics in the United States.

### Darnell Williams
(1944 - 2021)

Dr. Williams was the former Dean of Social Sciences and Education at Langston University in Langston, Oklahoma.

Dr. Williams was Professor Emeritus of Psychology and African and Afro-American studies at Washington University in St. Louis. A prolific psychologist, Dr. Williams is perhaps best known in linguistic circles for coining the term <em>Ebonics</em> to refer to the speech of African Americans in 1973. In 2018, Patricia Griffin interviewed Dr. Williams for the Arkansas Association of Black Psychologists Oral History Project, the audio is available on the <strong><a href="https://cdm15728.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p1532coll1/id/16637/rec/1" target="_blank">Central Arkansas Library System</a>
